@section standard_description Descriptions


Some words about some texts which are used in this documentation: \n
*- "The pointer to an etLink object pointer" \n
Means a pointer to a pointer ;) So if you have for example an etLink and yould like to alloc it, do it like that: \n
@code
	etLink *etLinkNew = NULL;
	etLink_alloc( &etLinkNew ); // Here is the pointer to the pointer
@endcode




@subsection standardFunctions Standard Functions


Every Object ( means etList, etString, etc. ) have standard functions.
These functions are describet here

*- <Object-Name>_alloc: This will allocate an new Object inside the memory and init it. \n

*- <Object-Name>_init: This initialisize an STATIC object \n
Be careful to use this function twice, some function will allocate memory internal. So if you call this function again,\n
the pointer to this memory get lost. This will cause a memory leak. \n
If you need to reuse the same object, you can clean it out.
So this functions are mainly for static objects. Means if you use temporary objects in your functions, its not needed to allocate
memory global.

*- <Object-Name>_clean: This will clean out everything inside the object, but the object itselfe is not freed. \n
This will not free any memory, only set it to initial state.

*- <Object-Name>_destroy: Acts like <Object-Name>_clean but frees the internal memory

*- <Object-Name>_free: This will free an allocated Object and set it to NULL! \n
Dont use this function on a static object, this will crash your application and burn out your brain ;)


Every function return a @ref etID_STATE
