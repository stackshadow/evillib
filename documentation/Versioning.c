The Versioning of the evillib gives you information about what you must do when somethings changed. \n
The version is splittet into three parts: \n
AAA.BBB-CCC\n

*- AAA(NUMERIC): This is for Major versioning. \n
If to much changes are done, a major release will be provided. \n

*- BBB(NUMERIC): This change improve the evillib with new functions \n
If some present defines/enumerations/functions are changed, its possible to recompile and review your code. \n
If new functions are added, this part of the version will not be changed, because its not disturbes the actual Program. \n

*- CCC(NUMERIC): If this change, you dont need to do something with the Program that depends on the evillib. \n
That means present defines/enumerations/functions are not changed. \n
If some fixes inside the Functions are made, this part of the versioning is incremented. But therefore you dont need to recompile your code \n
